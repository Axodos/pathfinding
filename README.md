pathfinding
===========

<p>
A java pathfinding library meant to be used for games.
It is generic enough to be used in different kind of graphs (though, right now it only has implementation for grid graphs).



It was heavily inspired by [this](https://github.com/qiao/PathFinding.js/ "Pathfinding.js") javascript library. Code initially was adapted, then
some modifications were made.

This library works with Libgdx's html5 backend, it was even used in my [#1GAM january entry](https://github.com/xaguzman/shiftingislands/ "Shifting Islands Source").
