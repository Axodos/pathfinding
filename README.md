pathfinding
===========

<p>
A java pathfinding library meant to be used for games.
It is generic enough to be used in different kind of graphs (though, right now it only has implementation for grid graphs).



It was heavily inspired by [this](https://github.com/qiao/PathFinding.js/ "Pathfinding.js") javascript library. Code initially was adapted, then
some modifications were made.
